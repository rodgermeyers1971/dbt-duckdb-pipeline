![dbt pipeline diagram](img/dbt_pipeline.png)

A public dbt + DuckDB pipeline over ~692k real job postings, rebuilt and republished automatically on every push.

- Models the raw postings into tested, documented insight marts
- Publishes the docs site and the finished warehouse: open to anyone, no credentials
- Runs itself on GitHub Actions: every push and every Monday

| What I Built | How I Implemented | Where to Look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **dbt pipeline** | sources → cleaned model → insight marts | [`analytics/models/`](analytics/models/) |
| **Data tests** | `unique` / `not_null` on every mart grain | [`schema.yml`](analytics/models/schema.yml) |
| **Hosted dbt docs** | lineage, descriptions, column tests | [Live docs site](https://YOU.github.io/REPO) |
| **Public CI** | build + test + publish on every push | [Actions workflow](https://github.com/rodgermeyers1971/dbt-duckdbt-pipeline/actions/workflows/dbt_build.yml) |
| **Environments** | local `dev` vs CI `prod` targets | [`ci/profiles.yml`](ci/profiles.yml) |
| **Published warehouse** | one `ATTACH`, queryable by anyone | [Query it](#query-the-published-warehouse) |

## ⚙️ The dbt Pipeline

Raw postings flow through declared sources → a cleaned staging view → insight marts, with tests gating every build. The DAG below is the whole flow:

![dbt dag diagram](img/dag-pipeline.png)

And the dbt features doing the work:

| dbt Feature | How I Used It |
| --- | --- |
| Declared sources (no hardcoded paths in SQL) | [`sources.yml`](analytics/models/sources.yml) + `source('raw', 'job_postings')` |
| Model dependencies | `ref()` everywhere downstream; dbt resolves order and parallelism |
| Materializations | project default `table`; `job_postings` kept as `view` |
| Data tests | `unique` / `not_null` on mart grains in [`schema.yml`](analytics/models/schema.yml) |
| Environments | local `dev` vs CI `prod` targets ([`ci/profiles.yml`](ci/profiles.yml)) |

`dbt build` compiles SQL, materializes models, and fails the run if any test fails: same command locally and in CI.

## 🚀 Production

GitHub Actions runs the whole pipeline, no laptop required: [`.github/workflows/dbt_build.yml`](.github/workflows/dbt_build.yml)

| Trigger | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Push to `main` | Full rebuild |
| Weekly (Monday) | Scheduled rebuild, pipeline stays fresh |
| Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) | Run button in the Actions UI |

On each run, Actions:

1. Installs deps with `uv`
2. Downloads raw parquet
3. Runs `dbt build` with the committed CI profile (prod)
4. Publishes `prod.duckdb` as a GitHub Release asset

The badge at the top of this README links to the latest runs.

## 🦆 Query the published warehouse

No clone required. [Install DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/), then from a `duckdb` session:

    INSTALL httpfs;
    LOAD httpfs;

    ATTACH 'https://github.com/YOU/REPO/releases/download/warehouse/prod.duckdb'
      AS jobs;

    USE jobs;
    SHOW TABLES;

    SELECT * FROM top_locations;

---

## 📖 Docs

Docs are generated with `dbt docs generate` and published to GitHub Pages:

**→ [YOU.github.io/REPO](https://YOU.github.io/REPO)**

The site shows:

- The full **lineage graph** (sources → models → marts)
- **Model and column descriptions** from the YAML
- Which columns carry **tests**

---

## 💻 Run it yourself

    uv sync
    uv run python scripts/download_data.py
    cd analytics && uv run dbt build

Optional docs locally:

    uv run dbt docs generate
    uv run dbt docs serve
